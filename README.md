```

## ⚙️ Configuration

- Firebase: update keys in `config/firebase.js`. The project uses `initializeAuth` with AsyncStorage persistence, Firestore, and Storage. Web enables IndexedDB persistence.
- Expo config: `app.json` includes icons/splash, `plugins: ["expo-video"]`, and EAS `projectId` in `expo.extra.eas.projectId`.
- Theming: Light/dark themes via React Native Paper; toggled with `SettingsContext`.

## 🔗 Deep Linking & Password Reset

- Flow:
  - From `ForgotPasswordScreen`, we call Firebase `sendPasswordResetEmail`.
  - The email link opens to configured domains and deep links into the app.
  - In `App.js`, linking prefixes include `https://luma-app-c2412.firebaseapp.com`, `https://lumaapp.page.link`, and `luma://` with a route for `ResetPassword`.
  - `ResetPasswordScreen` verifies `oobCode` via Firebase, lets the user set a new password, and handles errors/expired links.

- Notes:
  - Web and native are supported via React Navigation linking.
  - Generic success messaging prevents account enumeration in the forgot flow.

## 🔔 Notifications

- Permissions and tokens handled by `services/notificationService.js` using `expo-notifications`.
- Stores Expo push tokens in Firestore collection `userTokens` tied to the current user.
- Sends push via Expo Push API; also provides local notifications and badge counting.
- In-app notifications list uses Firestore (`services/firebaseService.js.notificationService`) with mark-read, delete, and unread count helpers.
- `NotificationsScreen` supports per-community toggles (via `SettingsContext`) and a clear-all action that also clears the device badge.
- `NotificationTestScreen` exists for development/testing.

## 🧭 Navigation & Performance

- Main app stack in `components/MainStackNavigator.js` with simplified, faster transitions and gestures disabled for snappier navigation.
- Auth/onboarding and deep-link routing are configured in `App.js` using React Navigation and the global `navigationRef`.

## 🧱 Additional Structure Notes

- Contexts:
  - `contexts/FirebaseContext.js` provides auth, profiles, posts, comments, messages, and notifications helpers.
  - UI/Settings contexts live under `components/` (`SettingsContext.js`, `TabContext.js`, `OnboardingContext.js`).
- Services:
  - `services/firebaseService.js` groups Firestore CRUD and realtime listeners for profiles, posts, comments, messages, and notifications.
  - `services/notificationService.js` manages device-level notifications and Expo push integration.
